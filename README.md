# The Relationship between Medical Predictors and Diabetes Illness

Objectives:

This project aims to uncover the key factors that may influence the risk of developing diabetes. By analyzing relevant data, we aim to uncover key patterns and relationships between various factors and the onset of diabetes. Based on these insights, the goal is to develop a predictive model that can help in estimating a person's likelihood of having diabetes, providing useful tools for early detection and preventive measures.
